Hi! I am an incoming MS student at [Computer Science Department](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/).

I am currently an intern at [Microsoft Cognitive Services Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cognitive-services-research/), mentored by Dr. [Chenguang Zhu](https://www-cs.stanford.edu/people/cgzhu/) and Dr. [Yang Liu](https://nlp-yang.github.io/). Previously, I spent some wonderful time as a research intern at Text Intelligence Lab @ Westlake University, advised by Prof. [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/).

My research interests include Deep Learning in NLP, Sentence Semantics, Natural Language Generation, Dialogue System, and Language Modeling. I am open to academic collaborations and please drop me an email if you have a research proposal.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
