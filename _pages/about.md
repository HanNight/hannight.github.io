Hi! I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Mohit Bansal](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/). Before that, I got my master's degree from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) and bachelor’s degree from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/).

My research interests include improving the robustness, efficiency, and reliability of LLMs/MLLMs, with a focus on reasoning, factual, and agent settings. I am also interested in knowledge-aware LLMs/MLLMs, particularly how models read and use external knowledge under real-world uncertainty. I always favor and pursue the methods that are simple, intuitive, and effective. I am open to collaborations and feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.

I've spent time at [AMD GenAI team](https://amdgenai.github.io/team/) with [Xiaodong Yu](https://www.xiaodongyu.me/) and [Zicheng Liu](https://zicliu.wixsite.com/mysite), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) with [Rinat Khaziev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rinat-khaziev), [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) with [Lei Cui](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lecu/), [Microsoft Cognitive Services Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cognitive-services-research/) with [Chenguang Zhu](https://www-cs.stanford.edu/people/cgzhu/) and [Yang Liu](https://nlp-yang.github.io/), and [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/) with Prof. [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/).
