Hi! I am an incoming Ph.D. student at [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Mohit Bansal](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/).
Now, I am a MS student at [Computer Science Department](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). 
Previously, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/).
I've spent time at [NLC Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-computing/) in [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (working with [Lei Cui](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lecu/)), and [Microsoft Cognitive Services Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cognitive-services-research/) (working with [Chenguang Zhu](https://www-cs.stanford.edu/people/cgzhu/) and [Yang Liu](https://nlp-yang.github.io/)), and [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/) (working with Prof. [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/)).

My research interests include deep learning methods for NLP, knowledge-enhanced NLP, and making large-scale language models more practical, efficient, and reliable. I always favor and pursue the balance of simplicity and effectiveness in NLP. I am open to academic collaborations and please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.
