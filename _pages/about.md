Hi! I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Mohit Bansal](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/).

I am currently working as a research intern at [AMD GenAI team](https://amdgenai.github.io/team/) with [Xiaodong Yu](https://www.xiaodongyu.me/), [Yusheng (Ethan) Su](https://yushengsu-thu.github.io/), and [Zicheng Liu](https://zicliu.wixsite.com/mysite). I've spent time at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) (worked with [Rinat Khaziev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rinat-khaziev)), [NLC Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-computing/) in [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (worked with [Lei Cui](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lecu/)), [Microsoft Cognitive Services Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cognitive-services-research/) (worked with [Chenguang Zhu](https://www-cs.stanford.edu/people/cgzhu/) and [Yang Liu](https://nlp-yang.github.io/)), and [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/) (worked with Prof. [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/)). 
Previously, I received my master's degree from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) and bachelorâ€™s degree from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/).

My research interests include making large language models more robust, efficient, and reliable, evaluating and improving LLMs' capabilities, and knowledge-enhanced NLP. I always favor and pursue the methods that are simple, intuitive, and effective. I am open to academic collaborations and please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.
